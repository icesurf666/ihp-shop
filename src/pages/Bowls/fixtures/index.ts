    Bowl Solaris
⠀
    The Bowl are produced by professional gonchairs. Its design resembles floral pots.
    ⠀
    Solaris - a flat-seven-hole cup of red clay with milk firing.
    ⠀
    Unique features of this model:
    ⠀
    1. The milk firing protects the bowl from the absorption of the syrup, which aids its durability.
    ⠀
    2. Unlike glazed bowls, it evenly distributes heat throughout the bowl More ...
    ⠀
    3. Flat bottom allows for more effective use of tobacco in the bowl.
    ⠀
    4. Standard size for smoking time of one hour and longer.
    ⠀
    5. The bowl is well suited for a loose load of tobacco of mid moisture. Increases richness of flavor and smoke.
    ⠀
    I also want to add that this bowl is one of the most popular in Russia. 
    We ourselves smoke using this bowl!

    The original texture of the clay was the inspiration behind its design. 
    Decorative notches are applied in a chaotic manner with a sculpey tool on a potter's wheel. 
    Despite its design, each bowl has its own unique design. 
    Its texture is pleasant to the touch and looks very brutal.

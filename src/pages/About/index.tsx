      Good afternoon! {br}
      We hope that you are well, and your business is up and running.{br}
      We understand that the hospitality sector has been experiencing
      unprecedented difficulties. Businesses will have to find new ways of
      attracting clients and maintaining its competitive position on the market.
      So, we would like to offer you a new product that, in our opinion, is
      going to boost your sales, attract new clientele, expand your service
      offering, and give you a competitive advantage. {br}
      The trend of hookah tobacco acceptance among people is increasing. It is
      projected to reach USD 3.31 billion by 2026 with cafes and lounges at the
      forefront of the trend adoption. Offering shisha services allows for
      increased stay time and therefore increases sales.{br}
      The product we would like to offer you is shisha tea. Shisha tea is
      presented and manufactured in Russia exclusively. Even though shisha tea
      is new to the market, it has successfully proved its best qualities over
      the last two years. This product may just be the breakthrough to kick off
      your sales post-pandemic. Shisha tea is the second wind in the industry.
      {br}• It doesn’t taste like tea. Simply put, shisha tea is your regular
      tobacco, but unlike regular tobacco, it is made of tea leaves instead of
      tobacco leaves. {br}• Shisha tea can either contain nicotine or be
      nicotine free. {br}• Shisha tea with nicotine can easily compete with such
      tobaccos as Tangiers and Hookahfina.{br}• Its quality and flavoring are
      not inferior to those of regular tobacco. {br}• Shisha tea flavoring is
      brighter and more natural than regular tobacco.{br}• It has the widest
      range of flavors, featuring your timeless classics like double apple,
      grape, and lemon as well as some unique flavors like Belgian cider,
      elderberry, and BBQ sauce. {br}
      Why believe us? We are proud owners of the leading shisha lounge based in
      Russia and we’ve been in the game for four years. Our expertise stems from
      close daily communication with our clients and we can confidently say that
      shisha tea was very well received not only by our clients but by the
      Russian market too. Russian tobacco market has grown tremendously in
      recent years and keeps on growing. In 2018 it has seen a growth of 32.6%.
      For example, there are 110 shisha lounges in a city of 1.500.000
      inhabitants. Tough competition stimulates us to follow all the arising
      trends and maintain our product quality. {br}
      We attached the price list of all our products for your convenience
      (prices are inclusive of delivery). The price list also includes other
      products like bowls, and hookahs. {br}
      Thank you for taking the time to read our proposal {br}
      We believe this can help your business grow and prosper {br}
